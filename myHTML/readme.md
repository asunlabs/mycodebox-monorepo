# How to automatically save your codes in VSC
 Throughout this tutorial, there had been a lot of trials and errors to exercise HTML basics. Pressing control + S regularly is a such pain in my finger whenever editing CSS codes for a webpage. 
 
 Luckily, there is an extension in Visual Studio Code to help automatically save codes we have written so far. I found the extension extremely helpful so wanted to share with other developers.  

## Live Server Extension Installaion
To autosave your codes follow below instruction in VSC.
<ol>
    <li>Search live server in VSC extension tap</li>
    <li>Go to Settting - User - Text editor - file</li> 
    <li>Select afterDelay in Auto Save tap</li>
</ol>

Now you can enjoy automated code save and maybe go one step further eager to automate other chores you had to do, just like myself.
