# What is functional programming? 
It is one of the programming styles/techniques just like OOP(objected-oriented programming). It has advantages like below

<li>Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change</li>
<li>Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output</li>
<li>Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled</li>
