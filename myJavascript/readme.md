# Javascript
Javascript has been evolving to take care of not only front-side tasks but also server-side and app. 

Below you can find 
<ol>
    <li> a hello world web server created with Javascript </li>
    <li> a hello world app script created with Javascript </li>
</ol>

Today, as of 2021, Javascript can be used in 
<ul>
    <li>Web browser</li>
    <li>Web server</li>
    <li>App script</li>
</ul>
Thus, what Javascript developer should do is to be able to write codes that work well in all the above environments. 

# UI and API
## UI
Consider UI in software engineer controller in Nintendo. User and game character interacts through the controller - user and web application interacts through user interface. 

## API
Think of API as a mockup in design. Mockup is a premade design material that can be applicated in many ways as designer want it to be. 

API is a premade programming application that is provided by companies like Google(Chrome) and Apple(Safari) in case of web browser.

Thus API programming is similar to adding a custom design element to mockup, which is like

```
your design + mockup(premade) = new design
your code + API(premade) = new application
```

To conclude, UI is for normal user and API is for developer
user => user interface
developer => user interface (as a user) + API (as a developer)

Finding a proper way to adopt API programming is the one of the important qualities of developer. 

Javascript has : 1) JS API 2) Host environment API(web browser, Node JS, Google app script)
JS API is determined at ECMA organization where standard Javascript language specification is set and distributed.
