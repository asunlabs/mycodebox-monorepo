# Learning Javascript essentials
This repository is a place where I have written a bunch codes to be familiar with Javascript essentials. What it covers and will cover is as follows :

- Asynchronous Javascript : Promise, async, await
- Functional programming : Array.filter, Array.map, Array.reduce, Array.slice, Array.concat ... 
- Design pattern : builder, command
- Callback hell
- Constructor
- CRUD
- Web : Node-DOM-Element-HTMLElement, json, Ajax
- React.js
- Three.js
- regular expression 
- this : global object, class instance, function.bind
