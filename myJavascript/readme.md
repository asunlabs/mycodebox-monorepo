# Learning Javascript essentials
This repository is a place where I have written a bunch codes to be familiar with Javascript essentials. What it covers and will cover is as follows :

<li> Javascript for front end development : as of Nov 2021</li>
<li> Javascript as a server side language</li>
<li> Javascript for artificial intelligence</li>
<li> Javascript for web3 and blockchain</li>

## Javascript : Front end
Most of early codes in this repository is dedicated to exercising web front end development skills such as creating an image slider, typing text effect, and creating a dragabble modal.

## Javascript and host environment
Javascript has been evolving to take care of not only front-side tasks but also server-side and app. 

Below you can find 
<ol>
    <li> a hello world web server created with Javascript </li>
    <li> a hello world app script created with Javascript </li>
</ol>

Today, as of 2021, Javascript can be used in 
<ul>
    <li>Web browser</li>
    <li>Web server</li>
    <li>App script</li>
</ul>
Thus, what Javascript developer should do is to be able to write codes that work well in all the above environments.
