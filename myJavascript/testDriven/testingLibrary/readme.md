# Learning testing library essentials
> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
the more confidence they can give you.

> The Testing Library family of libraries is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.

> DOM Testing Library works with any environment that provides DOM APIs, such as Jest, Mocha + JSDOM, or a real browser.

## Basics
> Testing Library encourages you to avoid testing implementation details like the internals of a component you're testing (though it's still possible). The Guiding Principles of this library emphasize a focus on tests that closely resemble how your web pages are interacted by the users.

> You may want to avoid the following implementation details:

1. Internal state of a component
1. Internal methods of a component
1. Lifecycle methods of a component
1. Child components
