# React with Typescript
Writing React codes by typescript has a few advantages. 

- Figuring out potential bugs as writing codes rather than at browser/runtime
- Describing an object shape in advance with autocomplete thus easier to documentation
-  Easier maintenance

Note that component is defined with .tsx extention and the app will break if .js or .jsx exists. 

- TypeScript : (.ts)
- TypeScript React : (.tsx)
