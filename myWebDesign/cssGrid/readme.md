# What is CSS grid model?

# How is it different from CSS flex box? 
Flex box distributes its box items by main axis - when there is no more space to use in the axis, the container moves the next items based on cross axis. 

Compared to Flex box, Grid allows developers to set each item location from the very first place using grid-template-columns(rows) property. Developers can designate width, height, and etc when needed. 

Both layout can be applied and used altogether in one program - they are not exclusive.
